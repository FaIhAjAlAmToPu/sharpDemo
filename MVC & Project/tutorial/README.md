# MVC Pattern Tutorial: Model, View, Controller

This tutorial clarifies the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, focusing on the clear boundaries between **Model**, **View**, and **Controller** in C# applications.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C# (classes, methods, objects).
- A C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code with .NET SDK, or an online compiler).

## What is MVC?

MVC is a design pattern that organizes an application into three components—**Model**, **View**, and **Controller**—to separate concerns, making code modular and easier to maintain. Each component has a specific role, and boundaries ensure they don’t overlap.

---

## Model: Data and Logic

### Role
The **Model** represents the application’s data and business logic. It’s the core that manages data storage, retrieval, and processing, like a database or a set of rules.

### Responsibilities
- Stores data (e.g., patient records, quiz questions, product details).
- Handles business rules (e.g., scheduling logic, scoring quizzes, calculating discounts).
- Interacts with data sources (e.g., databases, external APIs).
- **Does NOT**: Deal with user interface or process user input directly.

### Boundary
The Model is isolated from the UI and user actions. It provides data to the Controller but doesn’t control how it’s displayed or what users do.

---

## Controller: Coordinator

### Role
The **Controller** is the middleman, handling user input, updating the Model, and refreshing the View. It ensures smooth communication between the other components.

### Responsibilities
- Processes user input (e.g., form submissions, button clicks).
- Updates the Model based on input (e.g., booking an appointment, submitting quiz answers).
- Sends data to the View for display.
- **Does NOT**: Contain business logic or render UI elements directly.

### Boundary
The Controller only coordinates. It doesn’t store data long-term or define how data appears in the UI.

---

## View: User Interface

### Role
The **View** is the application’s user interface, displaying data to users and capturing their input.

### Responsibilities
- Renders data in a user-friendly format (e.g., web pages, app screens).
- Shows data provided by the Controller (e.g., appointment details, quiz scores).
- Sends user input to the Controller (e.g., form submissions, button clicks).
- **Does NOT**: Manipulate data or implement business logic.

### Boundary
The View is purely for presentation. It doesn’t access the Model directly or process data.

---

## Boundaries Between Components

- **Model ↔ Controller**: The Model provides data and logic; the Controller requests or updates data. The Model never interacts with the View.
- **Controller ↔ View**: The Controller sends data to the View and receives user input. The View doesn’t access the Model.
- **Model ↔ View**: No direct interaction. The Controller keeps them separate.

## Real-World Examples

### 1. A web app where patients book appointments with doctors

- **Model**:
  - Represents data like patient profiles (name, ID), doctor schedules, and appointment details (date, time).
  - Handles logic, such as checking doctor availability or preventing double-booking.
  - Example: A method ensures appointments are only scheduled during a doctor’s working hours (e.g., 9 AM–5 PM).

- **Controller**:
  - Processes user actions, like submitting a booking form.
  - Retrieves available time slots from the Model and updates it when a patient books an appointment.
  - Passes appointment details to the View for display.
  - Example: When a patient selects a doctor and time, the Controller validates the input and updates the Model.

- **View**:
  - Displays a calendar of available slots or a confirmation page for booked appointments.
  - Captures user input, like selecting a time or submitting patient details.
  - Example: A web page showing a doctor’s schedule with clickable time slots.

### 2.  A platform where students take quizzes and view scores

- **Model**:
  - Stores quiz data (questions, answers, correct options) and student data (scores, attempts).
  - Manages logic, like calculating scores or determining pass/fail status.
  - Example: A method calculates a student’s score based on selected answers.

- **Controller**:
  - Handles user actions, like starting a quiz or submitting answers.
  - Fetches questions from the Model and sends them to the View.
  - Updates the Model with the student’s answers and retrieves the final score.
  - Example: When a student submits a quiz, the Controller processes the answers and requests the score from the Model.

- **View**:
  - Displays quiz questions, answer options, and final scores.
  - Captures user selections (e.g., multiple-choice answers).
  - Example: A web page showing a question with radio buttons and a “Submit” button.

### 3. An online store where users browse products and place orders

- **Model**:
  - Manages product data (name, price, stock) and order details (items, total cost).
  - Implements logic, like applying discounts or checking stock availability.
  - Example: A method applies a 10% discount for orders over $100.

- **Controller**:
  - Processes user actions, like adding items to a cart or checking out.
  - Retrieves product data from the Model and updates it (e.g., reduces stock after purchase).
  - Sends product or cart details to the View.
  - Example: When a user adds a product to their cart, the Controller updates the Model’s cart data.

- **View**:
  - Displays product listings, cart contents, or order confirmations.
  - Captures user actions, like clicking “Add to Cart” or “Checkout.”
  - Example: A product page showing item details and an “Add to Cart” button.

## Practice Exercise

Create a simple MVC application for a **Library Management System**:
1. **Model**: Define a `Book` class with properties (e.g., Title, Author, ISBN) and logic to check if a book is available for borrowing.
2. **Controller**: Create a `LibraryController` to handle actions like listing available books or borrowing a book. It should fetch data from the Model and pass it to the View.
3. **View**: Design a simple UI (e.g., console output or web page) to display the book list and allow users to select a book to borrow.
4. **Test Boundaries**:
   - Ensure the Model only handles data and logic (e.g., no UI code).
   - Ensure the Controller only coordinates (e.g., no discount calculations).
   - Ensure the View only displays data and captures input (e.g., no direct Model access).

- **Controller**: Handles “Book Now” button requests, retrieves trip data from Model, sends booking confirmation to View.
- **View**: Displays ride booking interface with map and driver options, shows booking status.

**Data Flow**:
1. **End User (clicks a button in View)**: The user sees a "Book Now" button on the ride booking page, clicks it, and submits their ride details like pickup location and driver preference.

2. **End User → Controller**: The click sends the ride details (e.g., User ID, pickup location, driver ID) from the webpage to the RideController's Book method.

3. **Controller**: The Controller receives the details, checks that all required information (e.g., User ID, pickup location, driver ID) is present.

4. **Controller → Model**: The Controller passes the ride details to the Model.

5. **Model**: The Model checks that the ride details are complete (e.g., User ID is there, pickup location isn’t blank).

6. **Model → Database**: The Model sends a query to the Database to check if the driver is available.

7. **Database**: The Database looks up the driver’s status through query.

8. **Database → Model**: The Database sends back whether the driver is available or busy.

9. **Model**: The Model receives the driver’s status, confirms if the driver is free, and sends commands to save the trip.

10. **Model → Database**: The Model sends queries to the Database to save the trip and mark the driver as busy.

11. **Database**: The Database saves the trip and updates the driver’s status to busy.

12. **Model**: The Model receives the result from the Database, noting if the trip was saved with a booking ID or if it failed (e.g., "Driver not available").

13. **Model → Controller**: The Model sends this result back to the Controller.

14. **Controller**: The Controller looks at the result, decides if it should show a "success" or "error" message.

15. **Controller → View**: The Controller passes the result (success or error message) to the View.

16. **View**: The View turns the result into a message, like "Ride booked!" or "Driver not available," and displays it.

17. **View → End User**: The View shows the message on the page for the user to see.

I apologize for the inconsistencies. You're right—some steps included actions like "sends a request" within a component instead of using a transition, and some transitions between Database and Model were missing. I'll correct this by ensuring all interactions are handled via transitions and include the proper flow. Here's the revised set of responses:
