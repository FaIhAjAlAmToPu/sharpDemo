## Scaffolding
To add a scaffolded item (e.g., Controller with views):
1. Right-click the `Controllers` folder in Solution Explorer.
2. Select **Add > New Scaffolded Item**.
3. Choose **MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework**.
4. Select the `Book` model and `AppDbContext`.
5. Click **Add** to generate the controller, views, and CRUD actions.

### What it Does?
- Registers your DbContext if it’s not already configured.
- Generates a fully functional controller for the selected model.
- Creates corresponding views for each CRUD operation.
- Optionally modifies appsettings.json to include a connection string (if needed).

### What will you do?
1. **Configure the Database Context in Program.cs:** 
After builder is initialized, add the following code to register your PostgreSQL context:

    ```csharp
    builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseNpgsql(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("ConnectionName")));
    ```
2. **Build on This Foundation:**
Use the scaffolded controller and views as a starting point for your larger application. Customize the logic, layout, and design according to your project’s needs.
