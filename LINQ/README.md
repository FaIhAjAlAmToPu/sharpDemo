# Comprehensive LINQ Practice Questions and Solutions

This README provides a set of LINQ practice questions to help you master LINQ in C#, building on your knowledge of `select`, `from`, and `where`. The questions are divided into three sections: array-based, object-based, and database querying with Entity Framework Core. Each question includes:
- A problem description
- Solutions in **query syntax** (`from`, `where`, etc.) and **method syntax** (e.g., `.Where()`, `.Select()`)
- Expected results
- A brief explanation

Use the datasets below to solve the questions. Try writing the queries yourself before checking the solutions!

## Array-Based Questions

### Numbers Array
```csharp
int[] numbers = { 1, 4, 7, 2, 9, 3, 8, 5, 6, 10, 4, 7, 12 };
```

#### 1. Get Even Numbers Greater Than 4 in Ascending Order
**Question**: Retrieve all even numbers from the `numbers` array that are greater than 4, sorted in ascending order.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var evenNumbers = from num in numbers
                  where num % 2 == 0 && num > 4
                  orderby num
                  select num;
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0 && num > 4)
                        .OrderBy(num => num);
```

**Result**: `{ 6, 8, 10, 12 }`

**Explanation**: Filters numbers that are even (`num % 2 == 0`) and greater than 4, then sorts them in ascending order.

---

#### 2. Sum of Numbers Divisible by 3
**Question**: Calculate the sum of all numbers in the `numbers` array that are divisible by 3.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var sumDivisibleBy3 = (from num in numbers
                       where num % 3 == 0
                       select num).Sum();
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var sumDivisibleBy3 = numbers.Where(num => num % 3 == 0)
                             .Sum();
```

**Result**: `9 + 3 + 6 + 12 = 30`

**Explanation**: Selects numbers divisible by 3 and computes their sum using `Sum()`.

---

#### 3. Find the Third Highest Number
**Question**: Find the third highest distinct number in the `numbers` array.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var thirdHighest = (from num in numbers
                    orderby num descending
                    select num).Distinct().Skip(2).First();
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var thirdHighest = numbers.OrderByDescending(num => num)
                         .Distinct()
                         .Skip(2)
                         .First();
```

**Result**: `8`

**Explanation**: Orders numbers in descending order, removes duplicates with `Distinct()`, skips the first two (12, 10), and takes the next (8).

---

#### 4. Count Numbers Appearing More Than Once
**Question**: Count how many numbers in the `numbers` array appear more than once.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var duplicatesCount = (from num in numbers
                       group num by num into g
                       where g.Count() > 1
                       select g.Key).Count();
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var duplicatesCount = numbers.GroupBy(num => num)
                            .Where(g => g.Count() > 1)
                            .Count();
```

**Result**: `2` (4 and 7 appear twice)

**Explanation**: Groups numbers by their value, filters groups with more than one occurrence, and counts the distinct keys.

---

#### 5. Group Numbers by Range (0-5, 6-10, 11+)
**Question**: Group numbers into ranges (0-5, 6-10, 11 or more) and list the numbers in each range.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var numberRanges = from num in numbers
                   group num by num switch
                   {
                       <= 5 => "0-5",
                       <= 10 => "6-10",
                       _ => "11+"
                   } into g
                   select new { Range = g.Key, Numbers = g };
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var numberRanges = numbers.GroupBy(num => num switch
                          {
                              <= 5 => "0-5",
                              <= 10 => "6-10",
                              _ => "11+"
                          })
                         .Select(g => new { Range = g.Key, Numbers = g });
```

**Result**: 
```
{ 
    { Range = "0-5", Numbers = { 1, 4, 2, 3, 5, 4 } }, 
    { Range = "6-10", Numbers = { 7, 9, 8, 6, 10, 7 } }, 
    { Range = "11+", Numbers = { 12 } } 
}
```

**Explanation**: Groups numbers by ranges using a switch expression and selects the numbers in each range.

---

```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var isSorted = numbers.SequenceEqual(numbers.OrderBy(n => n));
```

**Result**: `false`

**Explanation**: Compares the array with its sorted version using `SequenceEqual()`. The array is not sorted (e.g., 4 > 7 is out of order).

---

#### 7. Get First Two Numbers Greater Than 5
**Question**: Retrieve the first two numbers from the `numbers` array that are greater than 5.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var firstTwo = (from num in numbers
                where num > 5
                select num).Take(2);
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var firstTwo = numbers.Where(num => num > 5)
                     .Take(2);
```

**Result**: `{ 7, 9 }`

**Explanation**: Filters numbers greater than 5 and takes the first two using `Take(2)`.

---

#### 8. Concatenate Numbers as String
**Question**: Create a comma-separated string of all numbers greater than 3 in the `numbers` array.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var numberString = string.Join(", ", from num in numbers
                                     where num > 3
                                     select num);
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var numberString = string.Join(", ", numbers.Where(num => num > 3));
```

**Result**: `"4, 7, 9, 8, 5, 6, 10, 4, 7, 12"`

**Explanation**: Filters numbers greater than 3 and joins them with commas using `string.Join`.

{
    public int BookId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }
    public Category Category { get; set; }
}

public class Category
{
    public int CategoryId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public List<Book> Books { get; set; }
}

public class BookshopContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }

    public BookshopContext(DbContextOptions<BookshopContext> options) : base(options) { }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Book>()
            .HasOne(b => b.Category)
            .WithMany(c => c.Books)

                                   _ => "Over $25"
                               })
                              .Select(g => new { Range = g.Key, Count = g.Count() });
```

**Result**: 
```
{ 
    { Range = "Under $15", Count = 1 }, 
    { Range = "$15-$25", Count = 3 }, 
    { Range = "Over $25", Count = 1 } 
}
```

**Explanation**: Groups books by price ranges using a switch expression and counts the books in each range.

#### 22. Join Categories with Books
**Question**: Join the `Categories` and `Books` tables to list each bookâ€™s title and its category name, ordered by category name.

**Query Syntax**:
```csharp
var bookCategories = from category in context.Categories
                     join book in context.Books on category.CategoryId equals book.CategoryId
                     orderby category.Name
                     select new { book.Title, CategoryName = category.Name };
```

**Method Syntax**:
```csharp
var bookCategories = context.Categories.Join(context.Books,
                                            category => category.CategoryId,
                                            book => book.CategoryId,
                                            (category, book) => new { book.Title, CategoryName = category.Name })
                                      .OrderBy(bc => bc.CategoryName);
```

**Result**: 
```
{ 
    { Title = "Novel A", CategoryName = "Fiction" }, 
    { Title = "Novel C", CategoryName = "Fiction" }, 
    { Title = "Novel E", CategoryName = "Fiction" }, 
    { Title = "History B", CategoryName = "Non-Fiction" }, 
    { Title = "Science D", CategoryName = "Science" } 
}
```

**Explanation**: Joins categories and books on `CategoryId`, orders by category name, and selects book title and category name.
